Please feel free to email us at {{ site.email }} to express your interest in participating while we hammer out the details.

## Past

### July 2020 Transcribe-a-thon

So far, we have hosted one community transcription event that spanned 4 days in July of 2020 (see dates below). In total, __37 volunteers__ contributed their time and expertise to correct __28+ collection transcripts__, which represent roughly __14 hours or 840 minutes of recordings__! This work is invaluable as we endeavor to make the collection more readily discoverable, accessible, and (re)usable for research.

__Session I.__    Wednesday, July 22, 2:00 - 4:00 PM (EST)  
__Session II.__   Thursday, July 23, 2:00 - 4:00 PM (EST)  
__Session III.__  Friday, July 24, 2:00 - 4:00 PM (EST)  
__Session IV.__   Saturday, July 25, 2:00 - 4:00 PM (EST)
